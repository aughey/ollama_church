00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:11,410
will not leave you orphans I will come

194
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:14,410
to you in a little while the world will

195
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:20,260
no longer see me but you will see me

196
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:23,560
because I live and you will live on that

197
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:29,520
day you will realize that I am in the

198
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:33,010
father and you are in me and I in you

199
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:37,540
whoever has my Commandments and observes

200
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:40,920
them is the one who loves me and whoever

201
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:46,980
loves me will be loved by my father and

202
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:46,980
I will love him and reveal myself to him

203
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:52,320
the gospel of the Lord

204
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:28,580
I was at dinner the other night and the

205
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:31,220
husband and dad of this little family of

206
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:34,850
now young adults was telling me a story

207
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:39,110
he had heard recently of a scientist who

208
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:42,710
had run 2,000 obituaries through some

209
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:46,040
sort of program that picks up on the

210
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:50,440
most commonly used words in obituaries

211
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:52,700
and what he came up with after running

212
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:55,790
2,000 obituaries through that program

213
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:58,600
what he came up with in the obituaries

214
00:18:55,790 --> 00:19:04,450
of the famous and the not so famous are

215
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:08,420
two words two words jumped out at them

216
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:09,680
one was John so if your parents name

217
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:15,740
you're dying you're doing pretty good

218
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:18,550
unless you're a girl second the second

219
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:28,360
word that jumped out at them

220
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:28,360
was the word help that's right help

221
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:38,900
they helped people driving home I

222
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:41,810
couldn't stop thinking really about that

223
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:44,780
little story he told that he had shared

224
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:49,820
with the rest of us and isn't that just

225
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:53,180
the truth people who help us who really

226
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:56,690
help us are dear to us quite often maybe

227
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:59,930
even strangers sometimes what those

228
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:03,410
obituaries tell us is that what we

229
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:08,360
remember about a person is that in one

230
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:10,370
way or another they helped us they

231
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,570
helped to succeed they helped us through

232
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:14,030
difficult times

233
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:16,670
they helped us finish what we started

234
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:20,360
they helped us create something new or

235
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:24,080
resolve something old they helped us get

236
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:26,440
back on track they had some sort of

237
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:29,090
impact on the world

238
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:31,720
they helped us dream

239
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:34,340
they helped us accomplish our dreams

240
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,919
they helped us get back up when we were

241
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:40,700
knocked down

242
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:44,870
they helped us back to faith they helped

243
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:51,080
us get back to hope again in little ways

244
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:53,269
and in big ways they helped us what I

245
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:55,879
hear commented on again and again is

246
00:20:53,269 --> 00:20:58,820
those frontline workers that we talk

247
00:20:55,879 --> 00:21:04,070
about so often and we thank so profusely

248
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:06,289
and rightly so they're helping us in a

249
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:10,070
way we really need to be helped right

250
00:21:06,289 --> 00:21:13,009
now and even though scientists isolated

251
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:16,070
in those labs trying to come up with

252
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:19,549
some way of repairing the damage of this

253
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:27,879
virus even though scientists are helping

254
00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:27,879
us they're having an impact on society

255
00:21:30,009 --> 00:21:36,820
what this rather abstract gospel is all

256
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:42,590
about is to tell us that in the triune

257
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:47,720
mystery we call God there is that in God

258
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:53,559
in the mystery that is always always

259
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:56,240
always helping us wanting to help us

260
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:58,789
that is always helping us helping us

261
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:04,759
from the inside out and from the outside

262
00:21:58,789 --> 00:22:09,789
in God helps us God is in our life to

263
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:14,749
help us and that in the triune mystery

264
00:22:09,789 --> 00:22:24,399
that does just that is the one Jesus

265
00:22:14,749 --> 00:22:24,399
called our advocate our helper really

266
00:22:24,639 --> 00:22:33,559
the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit is that

267
00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:36,769
in the China and mystery that is always

268
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:41,830
in us for us through us trying to help

269
00:22:36,769 --> 00:22:45,760
us are you hearing this my

270
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:55,140
friends we tend to think of how we can

271
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:55,140
serve God but can we let God serve us

272
00:22:55,950 --> 00:23:08,289
can we let God help us when we need it

273
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:09,730
or is God the afterthought because we're

274
00:23:08,289 --> 00:23:12,240
too busy trying to fix everything

275
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:12,240
ourselves

276
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:21,460
even so if we begin to know a God who is

277
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:24,100
ready and willing to help at all times

278
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:27,100
any time in the middle of the day at

279
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:29,470
night or the bright of day if we begin

280
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:34,630
to believe in and trust in a God who

281
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:38,860
once and is willing and can help us even

282
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:46,600
so we will begin to see that we really

283
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:48,960
can and rightly so help others no wonder

284
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:51,370
it feels so good to help people

285
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,159
it's because we are in the image and

286
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:59,110
likeness of the one who is a helper to

287
00:23:54,159 --> 00:24:03,820
all we are compelled to help because the

288
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:06,279
God in us is the helper you see it's who

289
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:09,850
we are it's it's who we are to help

290
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:15,279
people it's in our DNA in our divine DNA

291
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:22,059
to help others that's why it feels so

292
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:23,940
good to do it so many are hesitant to

293
00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:26,919
ask for help

294
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:29,080
we don't feel worthy of people's time

295
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:31,809
and attention we don't want to put

296
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:35,019
anybody out we don't want to be a burden

297
00:24:31,809 --> 00:24:39,760
on somebody we're too proud to admit we

298
00:24:35,019 --> 00:24:43,539
need help we want to maintain control so

299
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:47,169
we don't ask for help but in the process

300
00:24:43,539 --> 00:24:51,159
in the process of not being willing to

301
00:24:47,169 --> 00:24:55,330
ask for help we deny others the chance

302
00:24:51,159 --> 00:25:00,600
to be doing what God does all the time

303
00:24:55,330 --> 00:25:10,150
what God wants to do which is to help us

304
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:13,060
we're denying them that privilege I read

305
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:16,120
the other day that calls to the suicide

306
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:23,950
hotline in this country during this

307
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:28,750
pandemic have gone up 1,000% that might

308
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:31,870
be a troubling statistic to many but I'm

309
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:36,610
seeing all these people willing to ask

310
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:41,760
for help and that's not a small thing my

311
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:45,420
friends that's a miracle in itself that

312
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:49,450
people know that they're in trouble and

313
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:51,690
that they can ask for help before it's

314
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:51,690
too late

315
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:58,720
in these pandemic days there are a lot

316
00:25:55,660 --> 00:26:04,000
of people who need somebody who needs

317
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:07,750
somebody to help even if it's just our

318
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:11,800
company maybe to hang with them a bit

319
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:15,430
online or at a safe physical distance

320
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:18,330
away back in the old days when I as a

321
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:20,920
kid my parents would could make my day

322
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:23,470
when I'd say to them what are we doing

323
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:26,820
this weekend always afraid of boredom

324
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:29,800
and they would say we're having company

325
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:31,860
companies coming over Gary and they

326
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:34,440
would see me light up like a firecracker

327
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:39,370
that meant somebody was coming over and

328
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:42,010
to me that was so exciting company is

329
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:45,280
such a good way to help people

330
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:47,470
we need good company you and I and we

331
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:54,460
can be good company to others these days

332
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:57,490
what a wonderful way to help somebody

333
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:59,920
called me just a couple days ago and he

334
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:03,700
said he and his wife were not rolling in

335
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:06,570
cash by any means but we know there's a

336
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:08,160
lot of people worse off than we are and

337
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:10,110
so

338
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:13,470
do you have any thoughts about where we

339
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:19,820
can make a donation just to help a

340
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:23,400
little bit that's what I'm talking about

341
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:25,320
no wonder it touches us no wonder it

342
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:28,380
touches us even to the point of Tears to

343
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:32,750
see and witness people helping people

344
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:36,390
and there ain't no pandemic in the world

345
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:37,410
that can keep us from doing that let me

346
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:39,600
say it again

347
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:42,390
there ain't no pandemic in the world

348
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:44,730
that keep them keep us even though we're

349
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:47,490
sheltering in place no physical just to

350
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:51,480
all physical distancing that we can that

351
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:56,640
can keep us from helping people that's

352
00:27:51,480 --> 00:28:01,680
the truth and this thing about wearing a

353
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:04,410
mask holy cow let's up make this a red

354
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:07,560
thing or a blue thing let's I make this

355
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:08,970
about civil liberties are my rights the

356
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:13,080
only question that matters with this

357
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:15,750
issue are any issue in our lives is this

358
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:20,550
question is this going to help somebody

359
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:24,540
is this going to help anybody and if the

360
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:30,180
answer is yes hello that's all the

361
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:35,870
matters period and the sentence is this

362
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:35,870
going to help somebody anybody

363
00:28:39,639 --> 00:28:45,200
that's the only question that ever

364
00:28:41,779 --> 00:28:47,419
matters is it going to help anybody

365
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:50,929
because with this gospel with this

366
00:28:47,419 --> 00:28:55,309
gospel makes clear is that if this helps

367
00:28:50,929 --> 00:29:03,919
anybody it's gonna help me it's gonna

368
00:28:55,309 --> 00:29:06,559
help me to be able to help so many have

369
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:09,740
helped me personally through these eight

370
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:11,419
weeks of sheltering in place so many

371
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:14,630
have helped me in little ways by letting

372
00:29:11,419 --> 00:29:18,799
me borrow even a hair trimmer to cut my

373
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:20,690
unkempt hair to the other day someone

374
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:22,909
brought me a frozen ice cream chocolate

375
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:25,899
covered fruit topped ice cream pie

376
00:29:22,909 --> 00:29:25,899
woohoo

377
00:29:26,769 --> 00:29:34,760
the only thing missing was a donut on

378
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:36,769
top but this is happening all the time I

379
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:40,419
came home last night maybe at 11:00

380
00:29:36,769 --> 00:29:43,309
after a long walk in the evening and

381
00:29:40,419 --> 00:29:46,929
right there on a table just outside the

382
00:29:43,309 --> 00:29:49,279
doors of her chapel outside someone

383
00:29:46,929 --> 00:29:57,289
delivered food and said it there for me

384
00:29:49,279 --> 00:30:01,220
for when I got back I don't know about

385
00:29:57,289 --> 00:30:03,350
on the coasts because it always seems

386
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:06,610
like sometimes we think differently from

387
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:10,580
the coast to here in the Midwest

388
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:12,320
perhaps there they think of therapy is

389
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:14,659
almost a badge of honor and so people

390
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,309
talk about going to see their therapist

391
00:30:14,659 --> 00:30:19,399
so freely I've always noticed coming

392
00:30:16,309 --> 00:30:22,130
from st. Louis in the Midwest here it

393
00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:26,600
was perceived for a long time as kind of

394
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:27,740
a stigma to go to therapy we should be

395
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,740
able to pull ourselves up by our

396
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:34,519
bootstraps you know

397
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:38,389
wrong again banana breath sure that

398
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:42,190
might be humbling to ask for help but

399
00:30:38,389 --> 00:30:42,190
that's the right kind of humbling

400
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:50,149
that's the humbling of Christ

401
00:30:46,059 --> 00:30:52,990
that's the humility that opens for us

402
00:30:50,149 --> 00:30:58,309
who are willing to ask for

403
00:30:52,990 --> 00:31:00,130
the gates of heaven today and at the

404
00:30:58,309 --> 00:31:05,180
hour of our death

405
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:09,940
in these pandemic days more of us need

406
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:09,940
to have that humility to ask for help

407
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:16,850
starting with God

408
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:18,980
starting with God we can ask God for

409
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:21,170
help when we hit those troubled times

410
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:25,070
when I'm in troubled and I don't know

411
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:28,610
where to go we just sang all we have to

412
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:34,240
do is kneel down next to our bad there's

413
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:34,240
only one word we have to pray help

414
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:46,290
and remember that in the asking we are

415
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:50,100
opening up the possibility of a great

416
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:52,770
grace and a great gift even to another

417
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:59,250
human being when they when we ask them

418
00:31:52,770 --> 00:32:01,770
for help this week I had to ask for help

419
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:04,050
about a small thing maybe a small thing

420
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:08,160
to me it was a little bit bigger I had

421
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:10,860
to ask a friend for a favor and yes

422
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:16,190
honestly frankly it's always a little

423
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:20,430
embarrassing to me even from a friend

424
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:27,360
can I tell you her response she texted

425
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:31,290
back of course we love you thanks for

426
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:37,710
asking it means the world to us that you

427
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:40,010
did it fills our hearts to fill your

428
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:40,010
need

429
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:51,810
followed by triple hearts and five

430
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:56,730
exclamation points there you have it is

431
00:32:51,810 --> 00:33:02,550
a grace to ask for help and it is a

432
00:32:56,730 --> 00:33:08,000
great grace to be able to help and I

433
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:08,000
might add a privilege

434
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:30,140
to remember the old song many of us grew

435
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:34,760
up with it was from the Beatles and it

436
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:40,400
was called help it's kind of a fun song

437
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:42,410
and so in the light of this gospel about

438
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:45,410
this God who wants to help us all the

439
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:47,030
time wherever you are whatever you do

440
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:48,350
and if you're alone in your house you'll

441
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:49,820
probably got it the easiest because you

442
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:53,030
won't mind sounding and looking like a

443
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:54,920
fool but if you're with somebody else

444
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:58,300
have them join in especially your little

445
00:33:54,920 --> 00:34:01,510
kids and if you're with college students

446
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:01,510
good luck
